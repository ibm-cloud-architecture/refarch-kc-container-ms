# IBM Garage Event-Driven Reference Architecture

## Reefer Container Shipment Container Management

This project is a component of the [Reefer Container Shipment reference implementation](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/) of the [IBM Garage Event-Driven Architecture](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/) reference architecture. The Container Management microservice - implemented with Java and the Spring Boot2 framework - is responsible for managing the inventory of refrigerated shipping containers, or reefer containers, and processing all of the events related to the container entity across the reference implementation.

For complete documentation on this project and its peer microservices, reference the **[Container Management](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/microservices/container-management/)** microservice page in the [Reefer Container Shipment reference implementation](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/) gitbook.

## Build & Run

This project is built using the [Appsody](https://appsody.dev/) development framework. For a full understanding of Appsody applications, reference the Appsody [documentation](https://appsody.dev/docs) and [getting started](https://appsody.dev/docs/getting-started/) material respectively.

Specific deployment parameters are exposed in the `app-deploy.yaml` file for the [Container Management](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-container-ms/blob/master/app-deploy.yaml) microservice.

For complete documentation on the necessary deployment configuration and parameters, reference the **[Container Management](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/microservices/container-management/)** microservice page in the [Reefer Container Shipment reference implementation](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/) gitbook.
